## Network Requirements

### Firewall Configuration

The following ports need to be open for the application to function properly:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 22 | TCP | SSH access (admin only) |
| 80 | TCP | HTTP (redirects to HTTPS) |
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS |
| 5432 | TCP | PostgreSQL (internal network only) |

### Domain and DNS Requirements

- Primary domain for the platform (e.g., kug-platform.com)
- API subdomain (e.g., api.kug-platform.com)
- Valid DNS A records pointing to your server IP

## Third-Party API Requirements

The platform integrates with several third-party services. You'll need accounts and API credentials for:

| Service | Purpose | Required Credentials |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| GitHub | Repository tracking | OAuth App credentials, Personal Access Token |
| Twitter | Social media monitoring | API Key, API Secret, Access Token, Access Secret |
| YouTube | Video content tracking | API Key, OAuth Client ID and Secret |
| LinkedIn | Professional networking | Client ID and Secret |
| Discord | Community chat | Bot Token |
| Firebase | Authentication (optional) | Firebase project credentials |

## Browser Compatibility

The platform is compatible with the following browsers:

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome | 90+ |
| Firefox | 88+ |
| Safari | 14+ |
| Edge | 90+ |
| Opera | 76+ |

## Mobile Compatibility

The platform is responsive and works on the following mobile platforms:

| Platform | Minimum Version |
|----------|----------------|
| iOS | 14+ |
| Android | 8.0+ |

## Scaling Considerations

For larger deployments (1000+ users), consider:

- Implementing a load balancer
- Setting up database replication
- Using a CDN for static assets
- Implementing Redis for caching
- Containerizing the application with Docker and Kubernetes

## Backup Requirements

Regular backups are essential for data integrity:

- Daily database backups
- Weekly full system backups
- Retention policy of at least 30 days
- Offsite backup storage recommended

## Security Requirements

The platform implements several security measures:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- HTTPS encryption
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)

## Monitoring Requirements

For optimal performance monitoring:

- PM2 for process monitoring
- Nginx logs for HTTP request monitoring
- Database performance monitoring
- Disk usage monitoring
- CPU and memory usage monitoring

## Compliance Considerations

Depending on your region, consider:

- GDPR compliance for European users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data localization requirements
- Cookie consent mechanisms
- Privacy policy and terms of service
