# KUG Advocacy & Community Platform Requirements

## Core Idea
A unified platform for all city-based Kotlin User Group (KUG) chapters to:
- Manage members & ambassadors
- Organize meetups & hackathons
- Track contributions (talks, blogs, GitHub repos)
- Gamify engagement with leaderboards & rewards

## Key Features

### 1. City-Wise KUG Management
- **City-Based Groups**: Every KUG (e.g., Bangalore, Delhi, Jaipur) gets its own space
- **Admin Panel**: KUG leads can add members, manage tasks, and track contributions
- **Event Calendar**: View upcoming meetups & Kotlin events in each city

### 2. Member & Advocacy Tracking
- **Profile Dashboard**: Every member gets a profile with their contributions (talks, blogs, GitHub activity)
- **Task-Based Engagement**: Members complete tasks like speaking, blogging, or organizing events
- **Gamification**: Earn badges, rank up in city leaderboards, and unlock perks

### 3. Contribution & Impact Metrics
- **Kotlin Content Tracking**: Automatically track Medium blogs, YouTube videos, GitHub PRs
- **Social Media Integration**: Monitor advocacy efforts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Dev.to
- **City-Wide & Global Leaderboards**: Recognize top contributors in each KUG

### 4. Event & Hackathon Management
- **Host Meetups & Conferences**: Create events, manage RSVPs, and promote talks
- **Hackathon Tracking**: Allow KUGs to organize hackathons and track participation
- **Speaker & CFP Management**: Manage call-for-proposals (CFPs) for Kotlin-related talks

### 5. Rewards & Incentives
- **Point System**: Earn points for contributions, redeem for swag, KotlinConf tickets, or mentorship
- **Advocacy Levels**: Grow from "Beginner" to "Kotlin Expert" based on engagement
- **Exclusive KUG Perks**: Access private events, special courses, and networking opportunities

### 6. Tech Stack & Integrations
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) + PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth / Google OAuth
- **Integrations**: GitHub, Twitter, Dev.to, Discord, YouTube API

## Monetization Plan (Optional)
1. **Sponsorships**: Kotlin-based companies sponsor events, swags, and leaderboards
2. **Premium Access**: Exclusive training & mentorship for top contributors
3. **Affiliate Model**: Promote Kotlin-related tools/courses and earn commissions

## Next Steps
- Define MVP (basic advocacy tracking + city-wise groups)
- Onboard key KUG leaders for feedback
- Build & test with one KUG (e.g., KUG Bangalore)
